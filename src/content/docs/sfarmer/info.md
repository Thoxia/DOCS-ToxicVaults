**Hand over the keys to the farmer!**

sFarmer allows players to automatically collect farming items in their territory. With its advanced features and flexible management options, you can optimise farming processes on your server. Farmer members can customise their farm with a comprehensive menu support.

### Key Features:

- **Interaction:** We provide both NPC and hologram support for players to interact with their farmer.

- **Teleportation:** Your players can teleport their farmer to any desired location within their region.

- **Glow:** If your server has set the interaction type of the farmer as an NPC, players can change the glow status and color of the NPC.

- **Operations:** Farmer members can retrieve collected items from the farmer's inventory or directly sell them through the menu.

- **Farmer Logs:** Logs of many actions performed by farmer members are kept and can be viewed by other farmer members.

- **Member Management:** The farmer owner can promote or demote a member added to the farmer, thus restricting the actions that the member can perform within the farmer.

- **Permission Management:** The roles and permissions for farmer members can be set by the farmer owner.

- **Settings:** The farmer owner can enable or disable automation options like auto-harvest, auto-plant, and auto-kill.
